# InputHash

This application prompts the user to enter some input, and then it uses the sha256 algorithm from the hashlib library to calculate the hash of the input.
The hexdigest method is used to get the hash as a hexadecimal string, which is then printed to the console.

You can use a similar approach to hash data using other algorithms, such as MD5 or SHA-1.
